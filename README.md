# To-Do App

A to-do app where user can add, delete and mark task as completed or incompleted.

---

## Features:
Filter data based on given filters :

- Add task
- Delete task 
- Mark task as completed/incompleted.
---

### Note: 
- Whenever a new task is added, it's id becomes 201. Hence, if multiple tasks are added and if one of them is deleted, all the added task gets deleted.
- This is happening because of the api which was provided as it automatically sets the id of any added task as 201 and hence, does not increment it.
